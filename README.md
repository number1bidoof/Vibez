## What did you build?

it was supposted to be a mario cart style game in assembly, but i didnt want to break down my computer so i made it in pygame instead. It also kinda doesnt works well but we can call it **Mario Kart: From Temu**

## What language(s) or tools did you use?

Originally i wanted to use Asembly, but to install, process and load in files was really complicated, and I didnt want to have to debug in assembly *done it before, not doing it again*. Then I tried C, but i had a problem with pointers and **allocating memory space**, so I used **Python**, a language we all know and **Pygame** to visually simulate it

## Which AI tools did you use, and how?

**I did not write a single line of code**, I mainly used ChatGPT 4o & Google Claude, I asked it to generate certain code, then refine it if I needed it to do something else 
- ex: yo chat can you give me a grilled cheese
   - chat: gives me a grilled cheese but with cheader
   - me: chat actually can you give me a grilled cheese with mozz and cheader
   - chat: gives me a grilled cheese with cheader and mozz
it was a lot of **prompt engineering**, feeding chatgpt what to do and how to do it spesfically

## What did you do versus what AI helped with?

I really took the **vibe in vibe coding too hard** and did not write a single line of code **at all :\)**, but i helped install and load in files. AI basically coded the whole assigment, it was just me who came up with it and corrected it when it had a bug.

## What’s one thing you’re proud of?

I am proud of the charater customization, being able to choose between the different charaters and different car colors and it is really cool

## What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?

Improving on the physics about movement and making sure the user can only move inside the circle, also making **multiple tracks and levels**

Thats it :\)
